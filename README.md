How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on effectively plugging in all of my information to the already provided template.

Optimizations
I updated the containing elements to have no set height property, to ensure that they would always contain all of their content.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that Netlify has a built in form submission option that allows forms to be sent directly to my email - which I plan to utilize in the future.
